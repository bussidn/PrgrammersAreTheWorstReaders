# Programmers Are The Worst Readers

## Writing understandable code is important

### Cost of maintenance

Frequently Forgotten Fundamental Facts about Software Engineering" by Robert L. Glass, (an article in IEEE Software May/June 2001)
=> 60/60 rule

10% increase in essential complexity => 100% increase complexity in solution (software) complexity

maintenance typically consumes 40 to 80% (60% average) of software costs, and then that enhancement is responsible for roughly 60% of software maintenance costs, while error correction is about 17%

3 factors : long living technologies (COBOL / java) + long living businesses + growing technological stack

paradox : language let us write less and less code while we use more and more tech layers.

### We must read a lot of code

* knowledge transfert
* error correction
* business evolution

### consider easing the load

* express business logic
* write something you want/expect to read
* don't mix level of abstraction (https://codurance.com/2015/01/27/balanced-abstraction-principle/)
* craft convention helps : good naming + little functions

## We must fight bad habits
